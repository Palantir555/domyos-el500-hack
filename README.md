# Reverse engineering BLE comms in the Domyos EL-500 Elliptical Training Machine

This repo is just a collection of quick-n-dirty notes and code snippets written
during the process of reversing the BLE comms of the EL-500.

I just needed to understand how the device reports its status over BLE, and be
able to collect it with a custom device. For that reason, I have not looked into
most of the BLE packets sent by the target.
Other messages may be added in the future.

It is not intended to be a complete solution, or a tutorial for that matter.

I wrote a blog post describing the project in more detail. You can find it
